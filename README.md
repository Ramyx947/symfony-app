#Monocle Test
Convert the attached creative (monocle-test.psd) to a fully functional Symphony CMS based website. Make sure that you follow the design and grid as closely as possible.

###General requirements and considerations
- Ensure that your mark-up is W3C compliant
- Ensure that you use either HTML5 or XHTML Strict Doctype and CSS3
- You can use the fonts from the folder for reference on your machine. Use the included fonts.css for the web
- Make the page responsive, paying attention to key breakpoints and adapt the design accordingly
- For the form validation we recommend using jQuery or standard javascript
- The page should function and follow the creative in the following browsers:
    - Firefox 62+
    - Chrome 66+
    - Safari 10+
    - IE 11+
    - iOS latest
    - Android latest
- Ensure you use the latest stable version of Symphony, this can be downloaded from: http://getsymphony.com
- The finished site should be delivered as an Ensemble ZIP file (System / Preferences / Export Ensemble / Download ZIP)

###Comments section
